**Make a new branch and make changes in that branch.** 
Later we can finalise and merge the changes in the main branch

### If making changes to previously made file : 
**Make changes to the main branch directly.** 
However write complete description of the change that has been made

**Do not make changes to the root directory structure and basic skeleton.**
Feel free to make changes inside other modules folders.
